# tcx-to-csv
Converts TCX files into CSV. A compiled version is placed in the `tcx-to-csv.zip`.

Place your Garmin TCX files (for instance activity_581212121.tcx) in a folder and prepare an output folder. Provide them as input to the console app:

```
tcx-to-csv.exe -input-folder="c:\temp\garmin-files" -output-folder="c:\tcx-to-csv\result"
```
